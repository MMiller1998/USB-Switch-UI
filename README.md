# electron-quick-start

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](https://electronjs.org/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start).

## To Use

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/MMiller1998/pyUI.git
# Go into the repository
cd pyUI
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```

Note: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.

## Packing app for Windows

OPTIONAL: Create a directory `build` in the root of the project and save a `.png`, `.icns`, and an `.ico` image to use as the icon for the app. Else, the app will default to the electron icon.

All electron-builder to your devDependencies by running:
```bash
npm install electron-builder --save-dev
```

Add `"pack": "build --dir"` and `"dist": "build"` to the `"scripts"` section of your `package.json`. Create a new `"build"`secton in `package.json` and create desired fields. Consult the [electron builder wiki](https://www.electron.build/) to see all the ways you can customize your build. For packaging the app on Windows, create
```json
"win": {
  "target": "NSIS",
  "icon": "build/icon.ico"
}
```

Run `npm run dist` to start the build process. The executable should appear in the `dist` folder in the root directory.

Example of `package.json`:
```json
